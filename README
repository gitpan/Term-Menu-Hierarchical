Term-Menu-Hierarchical version 0.02
===================================

DESCRIPTION

Term::Menu::Hierarchical is a basic but hopefully broadly useful
hierarchical menu generator. Feed it a hashref of whatever size and depth,
and it'll display a menu with a nice console UI. The keys (or labels, if
you prefer to think that way) are used as the menu entries; once you've
followed the menu to the end of the chain (i.e., a value), that value will
be displayed in a pure-Perl pager that does not require any system
binaries.

The author finds it very useful for creating structured output for textual
data - usually as the "output section" following a parser that converts raw
data into a hashref. Think of it as a human-readable, interactive
Data::Dumper for text.
